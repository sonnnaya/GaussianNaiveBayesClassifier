# Gaussian naive bayes classifier
There is described and implemented Naive Bayes Classifier used for normally distributed values. 
This classifier works the most effectively for value's features that are independent to each other. 
So, if your classification images represented by much more complex and dependent to each other attributes, 
naive classifier wouldn't give some good predictions about image belonging to the class.

Follow [the link](https://github.com/sonnnaya/GaussianNaiveBayesClassifier/blob/main/GaussianNaiveBayesClassifier.ipynb) for more detailed information.
